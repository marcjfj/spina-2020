      # **A South Bay Tradition**


      Spina Farms Pumpkin Patch is located in beautiful Coyote Valley at the corner of Santa Teresa Boulevard and Bailey Avenue between (San Jose and Morgan Hill) in Santa Clara County. It is bordered by bright yellow sunflowers and filled with an abundance of amazing pumpkins. The Pumpkin Patch is open beginning September 27th through October 31st.




      Come ride the new SPINA EXPRESS TRAIN, explore our sunflower fields on an old-fashioned HAY RIDE Adventure, let 'em ripe with our PUMPKIN BLASTERS, try not to get lost in our CORN MAZE, and for our "little pumpkins" a BARREL RIDE just their size. With something for everyone, Spina Farms Pumpkin patch makes the perfect outing for family fun this Fall. Looking forward to seeing you!
